### ✨ Hey! ✨

My name is Anakin Fox, and I'm a digital gardener and hobbyist programmer from Illinois. Currently, I'm gardening in [Shooting Star Summit](https://summit-garden.netlify.app/), a place for me to learn and write. My current work includes exploring how my brain operates, as well as research on political organizing and power. I am also learning SQL and Python on the side as a compliment to my previous political organizing work. Data anaylsis and research has always intriqued me within this context.

My pronouns are she/they.
